# College Cohort Parity Simulation

To run the simulator app : clone repository, and run python3 app.py

Toggle the sliders to set offer acceptance rates for different genders/races, and click "calculate (unmodified)" for the baseline cohort selection method, and "calculate (modified)" for our cohort selection method.

Thank you for using our simulator!
